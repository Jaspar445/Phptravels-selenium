# Introduction

Phptravels-selenium project was created in order to build a framework for testing the PHPtravels website. Framework is written using technologies such as Java, Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, Maven, etc., and it uses the Page Object Pattern. In addition, it uses Allure library to generate advanced reports and it uses log4j2 library to display information in the console during testing. Ultimately, framework should cover most of the application's functionality.
